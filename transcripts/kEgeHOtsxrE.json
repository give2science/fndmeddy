about for automation and work", "start": 692.819, "duration": 5.04}, {"text": "like where are other people interested", "start": 695.16, "duration": 4.739}, {"text": "well so I think I'm the other thing", "start": 697.859, "duration": 3.63}, {"text": "we're really interested in and I'm", "start": 699.899, "duration": 3.391}, {"text": "really interested in is kind of like is", "start": 701.489,
