I", "start": 1782.19, "duration": 6.57}, {"text": "think even if like people have choices", "start": 1785.01, "duration": 5.61}, {"text": "like autonomous driving cars like", "start": 1788.76,

like the current product", "start": 1801.63, "duration": 2.58}, {"text": "all right so I think there are a lot of", "start": 1802.89, "duration": 3.81}, {"text": "advantages here number one I would say", "start": 1804.21, "duration": 5.79}, {"text": "is is the density right so you look at", "start": 1806.7, "duration": 5.75}, {"text": "you like look at how the city's plan may", "start": 1810.0,

don't know what pricing but", "start": 1881.87, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "I my imagination just feels like a fancy", "start": 1884.21, "duration": 5.73}, {"text": "service and could be like could be kind", "start": 1886.61, "duration": 4.559}, {"text": "of well the cost of making car is", "start": 1889.94, "duration": 2.67}, {"text": "significant but the driver cost in the", "start": 1891.169, "duration": 2.941}, {"text": "right sharing should go away ideally", "start": 1892.61, "duration": 3.87}, {"text": "yeah so basically basically like like", "start": 1894.11, "duration": 4.799}, {"text": "for for the for the for the bike itself", "start": 1896.48, "duration": 4.23}, {"text": "right now like we do not have a driver", "start": 1898.909, "duration": 4.65}, {"text": "we do not

like", "start": 1905.9, "duration": 3.6}, {"text": "cost wise we're going to be much lower", "start": 1907.669, "duration": 5.13}, {"text": "in terms of so can you compare the cost", "start": 1909.5,
